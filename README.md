How do you don't?

I love coding and game development, and have taught both for the past few years, as well as
making my own games and am probably addicted to all things C. //Which has led to a few arguements at microcenter;
and some good times! 
I went to art school, and have worked for Nintendo, Gearbox, and Shonen Jump. I also do stand-up comedy. 
I suppose thats a bit about me, for this example repo. 

It's been swell! 
//But the swelling's gone down.
